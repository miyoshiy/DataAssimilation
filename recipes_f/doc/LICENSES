     As the purchaser of a Numerical Recipes Unix distribution license
     you are licensed to install the programs in this distribution for 
     exclusive use on a single screen computer.  You are not licensed to
     move the files to any other type of computer, nor to use them on
     more than a single screen computer for each license purchased.
     If you have purchased a license other than a single screen
     workstation license, your written license supercedes this paragraph.

     License information for many types of computers (including UNIX
     workstations and servers, and multiple-user mainframes) is available
     from Numerical Recipes Software (see ADDRESS file for address).

     For educational and noncommercial users, we offer two ``streamlined''
     procedures:

              Educational License for Single-Screen Workstation

     If you are affiliated with an educational or not-for-profit
     research institution that is connected to the Internet, you may
     license the programs for use on a single workstation (one
     screen) as follows: Mail your name, address, and email address;
     your workstation's hostname, internet address, brand and model
     number; and a $50 one-time license fee (must accompany order)
     to Numerical Recipes Software, at the address in the ADDRESS file.
     Be sure to specify the language you want (FORTRAN or C). You will
     receive, by return mail or email, instructions for downloading the
     programs electronically.  Upon payment of the fee you may also, if
     you desire, upload the contents of the PC diskette (after unpacking
     the files with the PC NRCOPY program) to your workstation.

                   Right-to-Copy License for Courses

     Instructors at accredited educational institutions who have
     adopted Numerical Recipes for a course, and who already own a
     Numerical Recipes PC diskette or have access to a UNIX
     distribution, may license the programs for use in that course as
     follows: Mail your name, title, and address; the course name,
     number, dates, and estimated enrollment; and advance payment of
     $5 per (estimated) student to Numerical Recipes Software, at the
     address given in the ADDRESS file.  You will receive by return mail
     a license authorizing you to make copies of the distribution for
     use by your students, and/or to transfer the programs to a machine
     accessible to your students (but only for the duration of the course).
