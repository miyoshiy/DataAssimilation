          Can you redistribute Numerical Recipes in your programs?

     If you want to include Numerical Recipes routines in programs that
     are further distributed (either commercially or non-commercially)
     you can obtain permission to do so from Numerical Recipes Software.
     If the routines are bound into your program executable and are not
     separately visible to or useable by your users, there is generally
     no charge, provided that (i) advance permission is obtained, and
     (ii) a copyright notice like that in this distribution is embedded
     in your program executable.  Contact Numerical Recipes Software at
     P.O. Box 243, Cambridge, MA 02238 (USA) [fax 617-863-1739] for
     details.  In distributing a program containing Numerical Recipes
     routines, you acknowledge acceptance of the DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
     below, and of the fact that no business relationship is created
     between your program's users and Numerical Recipes Software, the
     authors of the Numerical Recipes books, or Cambridge University Press.

     If you want to distribute software that has Numerical Recipes in the
     form of source code or individually callable object modules, then you
     must contact Numerical Recipes Software for further information.  A
     fee (per Recipe) is charged, and we normally limit the total number
     of Recipes distributed to 20.
